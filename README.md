# restaurant-css-framework
## Introduction:
This project is to learn about the framework Bootstrap and learn to use it. 
[You can see a Demo here.](https://aichrak.github.io/restaurant-css-framework/)
## Instruction:
Create a repository called restaurant-css-framework in which you must realise a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but the type of food (burger, pizza, asian, …​) is your choice.

The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

Welcome
A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…​).

Menu
A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

Pictures
A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

Restaurant
A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

Contact
A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.

If you want to make an even more complex website feel free to try new things and make it as beautiful as possible.
